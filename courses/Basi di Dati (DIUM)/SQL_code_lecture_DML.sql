/* 

Let us now turn to the most important part of SQL, i.e., we are going
to see how to write queries to retrieve information from the database.

Rememeber that SQL is a declarative language, i.e., when you write a query
you just specify what you want to get from the database (the form of the
result that you want to obtain), without worrying too much about how such a 
result can be actually generated (the sequence of operations to perform, like
in relational algebra).

Given an SQL query, the DBMS passes it to the interval query optimizer,
which translates it into a series of operations based on a procedural 
language much like relational algebra.

As we shall see, there are multiple ways to write an SQL query, that can be
more or less readable and maintenable. Often, these different ways come down to
the same series of steps when translated into the internal procedural language
by the optimizer.
*/


/*

An SQL query is made by a set of keywords
The "fundamental block" of a SQL query is composed of the keywords:

SELECT  -------> typically, a list of attributes/aggregation functions/expressions applied to attributes
				 [this is similar to the projection operator of relational algebra]
FROM    -------> data sources (tables)
WHERE   -------> filtering conditions for the information that has to be extracted
                 [this is similar to the selection operator of relational algebra]

An SQL query should be read following the order: FROM, WHERE, SELECT

Similarly to what happens with relational algebra, also SQL queries always return a relation
as a result. Nevertheless, as we shall see, SQL considers multisets of data instead of sets.
Thus, we may actually have duplicate rows in our result, unless we explicitely discard them.

The full SQL block is given by all these keywords:

SELECT 
FROM 
WHERE 
GROUP BY
HAVING 
ORDER BY

*/


-- The most simple query that we can write involves just the SELECT keyword
-- The following query reads the current date from a variable internal to the DBMS,
-- called "current_date", and returns it.

-- As we can notice, the query actually returns a relation with a single row and a
-- single column, the latter called "current_date"
-- Thus, we can also say that the SELECT clause specifies the elements of the
-- schema of the output relation

SELECT current_date;


-- If we want to extract information regarding all professors, this can be done by
-- querying the "professor" table. In order to do that, we must also employ the keyword FROM
-- to state that "professor" is our data source.
-- * is a shorthand for "all columns"
-- The following query returns all whole rows that are contained in the table professor

SELECT *
FROM professor;

-- The query is equivalent to

SELECT cf, name, surname, email, promotion_day, kind, department_code
FROM professor;

-- In the select clause, we can refer to the attributes in whatever order we like, and 
-- we may also rename them using the keyword AS, followed by the new name

SELECT name, surname, cf AS social_security_number
FROM professor;


-- EXERCISE: select the codes of all courses





-- SELECT can also contain expressions that are evaluated over the attributes
-- of each tuple.
-- Expressions can refer to attributes or constants.
-- For instance, the following query returns a relation with a single attribute, 
-- that corresponds to the concatenation of name and surname attributes in professor

SELECT name || ' ' || surname as name_and_surname
FROM professor;


-- EXERCISE: assuming that "department.budget" represents the annual budget of a department,
-- return, for each department, its code together with the monthly budget
-- (hint: the division operator is "/")






-- Despite relations contain, from a theoretical point of view, sets of tuples,
-- SQL actually considers multisets of tuples. This means that replicated rows are
-- not automatically discarded from the result (the only exception, as we shall see, 
-- is when you employ set operators such as UNION, INTERESECT, EXCEPT)

SELECT * 
FROM teaches;

SELECT professor_cf
FROM teaches;


-- If we want to extract the ssn of all students that follow at least one course,
-- then it makes sense to remove the duplicates from the result. In order to do that,
-- we can employ the keyword "DISTINCT" together with SELECT.
-- Select discards replicated rows in the result of the query.

SELECT DISTINCT professor_cf
FROM teaches;


/*
Within SELECT we can also employ the so called "aggregate functions"

An aggregate function performs an operation over a set of values and, as
a result, it generates a single value.

For instance, the aggregate function "max", applied over the field 
"course.hours", returns the maximum amount of hours that appears in such a column

Thus, aggregate functions allow us to evaluate properties that depend on
several tuples

Other aggregate functions are:
	- avg: average value
	- min: minimum value
	- stddev: standard deviation
	- sum: sum of the values
	- count: number of values (number of tuples)
*/

SELECT max(hours) as maximum_hours
FROM course;



-- EXERCISE: extract the minimum and average number of hours of the courses






/*
Let us now add the last ingredient still missing from the "fundamental block", i.e., the keyword WHERE.
Through such a keyword we may specify much more complex queries than the ones seen up to now.

The WHERE clause is evaluated over each tuple, to determine whether it should or should not belong to
the query result.
Thus, the result of the query is composed on only those tuples that satisfy the WHERE clause.

The value generated by the WHERE clause is a boolean one (True or False).
Within the clause we can specify boolean conditions over attributes and constants, that make 
use of the operators: >, <, =, !=, >=, <= 

Example: attr_a < attr_b
Example: attr_a = 'Mary'

The single conditions can be combined by means of parentheses and the usual connectives: AND, OR, NOT

Example: attr_a > 5 AND NOT(attr_b = 'c' AND attr_c = 'attr_d')
Will return only the tuples such that attr_a > 5, and attr_b != 'c' or  attr_c != 'attr_d' or both !=
*/



-- Extract all professors belonging to the department "DMIF"

SELECT *
FROM professor
WHERE department_code = 'DMIF';


-- EXERCISE: extract all full professors belonging to the department "DMIF" 



-- EXERCISE: extract the oldest promotion_day all full professors not belonging to the department "DMIF" 




-- The following query returns number of courses with a number of hours strictly greater than 18 

SELECT *
FROM course
WHERE hours > 18;




-- The count operator takes as input "*", or the name of a single column, for
-- instance COUNT(name). In this second case, it allows us to use the keyword DISTINCT, 
-- to count just the distinct values occurring in such a column.
-- Pay attention not to mistake COUNT with SUM.

-- Extract the number of courses

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM courses;


-- Extract the number of courses with at least one edition

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT course_code)
FROM course_edition;

-- Without the keyword DISTINCT we would have extracted the number of
-- course_editions instead




-- The presence of NULL values can be tested with the "IS NULL" construct
-- It returns True if the tested attribute is NULL, False otherwise
-- In the same way, we can test for "non null values" with "IS NOT NULL"

-- For instance, let us return all professors without an email address

SELECT *
FROM professor
WHERE email IS NULL;


-- EXERCISE: extract all courses that have an email address




-- Any comparison that involves the NULL value returns NULL (meaning, "unknown").
-- The only exception is the previously seen "is null" construct, which may return
-- true or false

SELECT 5 = NULL;

-- The same holds even if we test NULL with NULL:

SELECT NULL = NULL;

-- Thus, the only correct way to handle NULL values is through the IS NULL constraint.

-- Actually, in PostgreSQL there is the COALESCE function which replaces the NULL with
-- a given default value within a query

SELECT COALESCE(email, 'UNDEFINED VALUE')
FROM professor;




/*
By means of the FROM clause, it is also possible to combine two or more tables.
If two tables are specififed in the FROM clause, then the cartesian product between them is performed.

The cartesian product of two sets A and B combines every element of A with 
every element of B

A = {a, b, c}
B = {1, 2}
A x B = {(a,1), (a,2), (a,3), (b,1), (b,2), (b,3), (c,1), (c,2), (c,3)}

Thus, as for our relations, every tuple of the first relation (with N columns and n rows) 
gets combined with every tuple of the second relation (with M columns and m rows). 
The result is a new relation having M+N columns and m*r rows.

Similarly, if 3 tables are specified in the FROM clause, the cartesian product among three
tables is performed, and so on.
*/


SELECT * 
FROM professor;

SELECT *
FROM department;

SELECT *
FROM professor, department;



/*
We can specify more than once the same table in the FROM clause
In that case, we perform the cartesian product between the table
and itself.
Note that the AS construct must be used in the following query to
disambiguate the two references to the same table.
*/

SELECT *
FROM professor AS prof_a, professor AS prof_b;


/*
In essence, the operation can be thought of as performing two copies
of table professor: one table named prof_a, and the other named prof_b.
This allows to disambiguate attributes that have the same name, 
for instance, prof_a.ssn and prof_b.ssn
*/

SELECT prof_a.cf, prof_b.cf
FROM professor AS prof_a, professor AS prof_b;


-- Instead, the following query throws an error due to the ambiguous reference to "cf"

SELECT cf
FROM professor AS prof_a, professor AS prof_b;



/*
Of course, the usefulness of such an operation alone is quite limited.
Typically, the cartesian product is combined with a filtering operation specified by means
of the WHERE clause.

The following query performs the cartesian product between the tuples of professor and those
of department. Then, from the result, it keeps just those tuples such that 
instructor.department_name = department.name

In other words, in this way we can extract information regarding all our professors, together
with that of the departments they belong to.
*/


SELECT *
FROM professor, department
WHERE professor.department_code = department.code;


-- Observe that, by means of the "table.attribute" notation, we can specify the table each attribute

/*
WHAT IS CONTAINED IN THIS COMMENT HAS NOT BEEN SEEN DURING THE LECTURES.
THUS, IT WILL NOT BE INCLUDED IN THE EXAM.


What if we wanted to extract information regarding each course, together with its prerequisites?
Such a query sinvolves using a copy of the table course.
In SQL, to do that, we can use table renaming, by means of keyword AS.

SELECT c1.*, c2.*
FROM course as c1
		JOIN prerequisite on prerequisite.course_code = c1.code
		JOIN course as c2 on prerequisite.prereq_code = c2.code;
		
-- Note again that, in this case, we are required to use our "table.attribute" notation, in order
-- to refer to the attributes in an unambiguous way.

What has happened in such a query? Can you spot anything missing from the result?
We actually lost information regarding all the courses without any prerequisites.

What if we wanted to extract information regarding all courses and, for those with 
prerequisites, also information regarding those?

The overall idea is to keep all rows belonging to table course, even those that never match
any other tuple through the JOIN condition. This can be done by means of the OUTER JOIN 
construct.


There are: LEFT/RIGHT/FULL OUTER JOIN constructs

Given two tables, A and B:

A LEFT OUTER JOIN B: performs the join betweeen A and B. Then, to the result set,
                     it also adds all the tuples from A that did not match any row
					 in B. For such rows, the values of the attributes that would 
					 have come from a matching tuple of B are set to NULL.
					 
A RIGHT OUTER JOIN B: performs the join betweeen A and B. Then, to the result set,
                      it also adds all the tuples from B that did not match any row
					  in A. For such rows, the values of the attributes that would 
					  have come from a matching tuple of A are set to NULL.
					  
A FULL OUTER JOIN B: performs the join betweeen A and B. Then, to the result set,
                     it also adds all the tuples from A that did not match any row
					 in B. For such rows, the values of the attributes that would 
					 have come from a matching tuple of B are set to NULL. Then, 
                     it also adds all the tuples from B that did not match any row
					 in A. For such rows, the values of the attributes that would 
					 have come from a matching tuple of A are set to NULL.


-- Extract information regarding all courses, possibly with the information related
-- to their prerequisite

SELECT c1.*, c2.*
FROM course as c1
		LEFT OUTER JOIN prerequisite on prerequisite.course_code = c1.code
		LEFT OUTER JOIN course as c2 on prerequisite.prereq_code = c2.code;

-- Thus, the "JOIN" notation allows us also to account for the "OUTER" cases


-- EXERCISE: extract information regarding all courses. For the courses with
--           course editions, we also want to get information regarding the latter

SELECT *
FROM course 
		LEFT OUTER JOIN course_edition on course.code = course_edition.course_code;

*/




/*
Let us now see another example in which the renaming operation is useful

What if we wanted to extract information regarding all courses that have a 
number of hours higher than the lowest one?

Such a query compares tuples of table course with other tuples of the same table
*/


SELECT DISTINCT c1.*
FROM course as c1
		JOIN course as c2 on c1.hours > c2.hours;


-- Note that we need the keyword DISTINCT here. Otherwise, we would get repeated
-- rows in the result (try that)


-- EXERCISE: extract information regarding all courses that have less hours than
--           the maximal number of hours




/* 

SET OPERATIONS


SQL includes, as already mentioned, set operators. They are:
	- UNION (ALL)
	- INTERSECT (ALL)
	- EXCEPT (ALL)
	
Such operators are defined following classical set theory.
Thus, when you employ them, this is the only case in which SQL automatically
removes duplicate tuples.

If instead you want to keep also duplicates, you have to employ the 
keyword ALL.

As what we have already seen talking about relational algebra, also in SQL
two relations must be compabile for what concerns their attributes if we want
to apply a set operator. Here, compatible means that they must have the same
number of attributes, and such attributes must have (pair-wise) the same domains.

*/


-- Remember the query that extracted information regarding all courses that
-- have a number of hours higher than the lowest one.

-- EXERCISE: what if we wanted to extract information regarding all courses with 
--           the minimum amount of hours?




/* 
We followed here a "CANDIDATES - NOGOOD" strategy .

"Return a course if it has the minimal amount of hours" can be transalated as:

	- from those, remove the courses that have an amount of hours higher than another one
*/



-- EXERCISE: find all course editions that have been held either in 2020 or 2021.
--           Of course, this can be done also without set operators, by try to use them.




-- Equivalently...

select *
from course_edition
where year = 2020 or year = 2021;



-- EXERCISE: find the code of all courses that have an edition in both 2020 and 2021





/*
Thanks to table renaming through the AS construct, SQL allows us to "count in a bounded way",
by performing "table copies" as we did with relational algebra.

This means that it is possible to specify a query such as "find the direct prerequisites of course X"

Also, it is possible to retreive "the direct prerequistes of the direct prerequisites of course X"

How can we deal with a situation in which we do not know the "length" of this chain of relations?
In other words, how can we write "unbounded" queries? 

If we want to extract all direct and indirect prerequisites of course "OBINF", we must rely on
RECURSIVE QUERIES.

we may proceed as follows:

A CTE can be considered as a temporary table that is built whithin a given query, can 
be seen just by that specific query, and ceases to exist when the query finishes its 
execution.
