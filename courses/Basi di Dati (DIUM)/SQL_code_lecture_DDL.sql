/*
The first step that we have to perform is connecting to a running server in PdAdmin.
This can be done by simply double clicking on the server name (let us use the local server, 
that should be named starting with "PostgreSQL") using the "Browser" on the left side of 
PgAdmin's graphical user interface. If asked for a password, insert the one that you set up
during PostgreSQL installation.

Then, with a right click of the mouse on the name of the server, select "Create", and then "Server".
Give the server a name, for instance "University_example", and then hit the button "Save".

Now connect to the newly created server by double clicking on its name.
Next, go to "Tools", in the upper side of the PgAdmin interface, and select "Query Tool".
All of the following instructions should be run within the Query Tool window.

When you create new tables, constraints or idexes, you can keep track of them by simply
navigating the "Browser". If a newly created item does not appear in the browser, simply refresh 
the latter by right clicking on the database name and hitting "Refresh".

/* 
SQL has two main sub-languages: DDL and DML

DDL stands for Data Definition Language, and it allows us to specify 
information about relations (operate on the schema), including:
	- the schema for each relation (i.e., the "skeleton" of the table)
	- the domain values associated with each attribute
	- integrity constraints (intra- and inter- relational)
	- ...
	
DML stands for Data Manipulation Language, and it allows us to operate on the 
relation instances, and thus to:
	- retrieve tuples
	- modify tuples
	- remove tuples
*/




/*
Let us begin with the DML. 
We will implement the following relational logical model, that we
have previously obtained from the translation of an ER diagram



book(isbn, title, editor, edition)
	PK: {isbn}
	NOT NULL: title, editor, edition
	UNIQUE: {title, editor, edition}

author(name, surname)
PK: {name, surname}

written_by(author_name, author_surname, book_isbn)
	PK: {author_name, author_surname, book_isbn}
	FK: {written_by.author_name, written_by.author_surname} -> {author.name, author.surname}
		{written_by.book_isbn} -> {book.isbn}




course(code, hours, name)
	PK: {code}
	NOT NULL: hours, name

course_edition(course_code, year)
	PK: {course_code, year}
	FK: (course_edition.course_code) -> (course.code)

prerequisite(course_code, prereq_code)
	PK: {course_code, prereq_code}
	FK: (prerequisite.prereq_code) -> (course.code)
	FK: (prerequisite.course_code) -> (course.code)




professor(cf, name, surname, email, promotion_day, kind, department_code)
	PK: {cf}
	NOT NULL: name, surname, kind, department_code
	FK: (professor.department_code) -> (department.code)

department(code, name, budget, professor_cf) 
	PK: {code}
	NOT NULL: name, budget, professor_cf
	UNIQUE: {professor_cf}, {name}
	FK: (department.professor_cf) -> (professor.cf)

phone(number, professor_cf)
	PK: {number}
	NOT NULL: {professor_cf}
	FK {phone.professor_cf} -> {professor.cf}

		


can_teach(course_code, professor_cf)
	PK: {course_code, professor_cf}
	FK: (can_teach.course_code) -> (course.code)
		(can_teach.professor_cf) -> (professor.cf)

teaches(course_year, course_code, book_isbn, professor_cf)
	FK: (teaches.course_year, teaches.course_code) -> (course_edition.course_code, course_edition.year)
		(teaches.book_isbn) -> (book.isbn)
		(teaches.professor_cf) -> (professor.cf)




Remember, finally, the further constraints that should be specified:
	* a professor has at least a phone number
	* a department has at least one professor
	* "kind" in "professor" can only have the values "full" or "associate"
	* a professor should be capable of teaching at least one course (relation "can_teach")
	* every course must have a professor capable of teaching it (relation "can_teach")
	* "author" and "book" have a total participation to the relation "written_by"
	* "book", "course_edition" and "professor" have a total participation to the relation "teaches"
	* a professor can only teach course_editions (rel. "teaches") of courses he/she is allowed to (rel. "can_teach")

There is the derived attribute "#professors" which has been removed from table "department".
We will get it back through the definition of a view.

/*
SQL provides a set of data types that can be used to define the domains
of the attributes.
Data types include, for instance:
	- boolean
	- numeric data types: 
		# exact: numeric(num_total_digits, num_decimal_digits), integer, smallint
		# approximate: real, double precision
	- characters and strings:
		# char(len): fixed-length character string, of size len
		# varchar(len): variable-length character string, up to size len
		# varchar: string of variable length, unbounded
	- temporal data types:
		# instants: date, time, timestamp 
		# intervals: interval 
		
Other than this "base" data types, later versions of Postgres offer JSON and JSONB, 
which can be used to store semi-structured information within an attribute.
We are not going to cover them in this course.
		
For a full reference, please visit: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype.html

As we shall see, starting from the offered data types, users can define their own
data types. This is useful, for instance, if we want to associate a domain to an
attribute "mark" within an "exam" relation, where the mark should be an integer
between 0 and 30.
Or, we may want to create the type "type_salary" which is defined
as base type numeric(8,2), with an allowable range that goes from 0,00 to 200.000,00

Alright, now we can add the foreign key FK: (professor.department_code) -> (department.code)
This can be done using an "ALTER" instruction.

The command ALTER allows us to perform changes to relation schemas.

In fact, tables (relations) can be modified both for what concerns their 
structure (schema), as well as their content (instance).

Instructions to modify the schema:
	- ALTER TABLE [table name] [ADD/DROP] [COLUMN/CONSTRAINT/...] [name of the object].
		Es., ALTER TABLE advises ADD COLUMN months integer not null
	- DROP TABLE [table name]
	    ES., DROP table advises
		
Instructions to modify the instance (DML, we will see that...):
	- INSERT INTO [table name] VALUES ...
	- DELETE FROM [table name] [CONDITION]
	- UPDATE 
	
For now, be aware of the difference between instructions that operate on the schema and
those that instead operate on the instance of a relation (e.g., ALTER vs UPDATE, and DELETE vs DROP)
